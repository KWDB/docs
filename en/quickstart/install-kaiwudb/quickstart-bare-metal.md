## Deploy KWDB

### Deploy KWDB Using Scripts

When deploying KWDB using scripts, the system verifies configuration files, runtime environment, hardware setup, and software dependencies. The deployment will proceed with a warning if hardware requirements are not met but will abort with error messages if required software dependencies are missing.

Deployment logs are saved in the `log` directory within `kwdb_install`. Once deployment is complete, KWDB will be packaged as a system service (`kaiwudb`), and the following files will be generated:

- `kaiwudb.service`: Configures CPU resources for KWDB.
- `kaiwudb_env`: Configures startup flags for KWDB.

#### Prerequisites

- The installation package is obtained.
- The target node meets all requirements for hardware, operating system, software, and ports.
- The user performing the installation is the `root` user or a regular user with `sudo` privileges:
  - `root` users or users with passwordless `sudo` configured will not be prompted for a password during script execution.
  - Users without passwordless `sudo` will be prompted to enter a password to escalate privileges.

#### Steps

1. Log in to the target node and edit the `deploy.cfg` file in the `kwdb_install` directory.

    ::: warning Note

    By default, the `deploy.cfg` configuration file includes cluster configuration parameters. Remove or comment out the `[cluster]` section.

    :::

    Example:

    ```yaml
    [global]
    secure_mode=tls
    management_user=kaiwudb
    rest_port=8080
    kaiwudb_port=26257
    # brpc_port=27257
    data_root=/var/lib/kaiwudb
    cpu=1

    [local]
    node_addr=your-host-ip

    # [cluster]
    # node_addr=your-host-ip, your-host-ip
    # ssh_port=22
    # ssh_user=admin
    ```

    Parameters:

    | Configuration Level | Parameter | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | **global** | `secure_mode` | Defines the security mode. Options include:<br>- `insecure`: Enables insecure mode.<br>- `tls`: (Default) Enables secure mode. This generates TLS certificates for client and application connections, stored in `/etc/kaiwudb/certs`.|
    | | `management_user` | The user account for managing KWDB, set to `kaiwudb` by default. After installation, KWDB creates this user and a user group with the same name. |
    | | `rest_port` | Port for web services (default: `8080`). |
    | | `kaiwudb_port` | Port for client and application connections (default: `26257`). |
    | | `brpc_port` | The brpc communication port between KWDB time-series engines, used for inter-node communication. <br>This parameter can be omitted for single-node deployments; if specified, the system will automatically ignore it. |
    | | `data_root` | Data directory (default: `/var/lib/kaiwudb`). |
    | | `cpu` | (Optional) Specifies CPU usage for KWDB on the node. The default is unlimited. The value range is [0,1], with a precision of up to two decimal places. <br>**Note:** If the deployment environment is **Ubuntu 18.04**, you need to modify the `CPUQuota` value in the `kaiwudb.service` file after deployment is complete. Specifically, change any decimal values to integers (e.g., change `180.0%` to `180%`) to ensure the setting takes effect. For instructions, see [CPU Usage Configuration](../../deployment/cluster-config/cluster-config-bare-metal.md#manage-cpu-resources). |
    | **local** | `node_addr` | The IP address for client and application connections. The default listening address is `0.0.0.0`, meaning the node will listen on `kaiwudb_port` across all IP addresses on the host. |

2. Grant execution permission to the `deploy.sh` script.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. Install KWDB in single-node mode.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh install --single
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the console will display the following message:

    ```shell
    INSTALL COMPLETED: KaiwuDB has been installed successfully!
    ```

4. Reload the `systemd` daemon configuration.

    ```shell
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

5. Start KWDB.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh start
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the console will display the following message:

    ```shell
    START COMPLETED: KaiwuDB has started successfully.
    ```

6. Check the database status.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh status
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    systemctl status kaiwudb
    ```

7. (Optional) Enable KWDB to start automatically after a system reboot.

    ```shell
    systemctl enable kaiwudb
    ```

8. (Optional) Run the `add_user.sh` script to create a database user. If skipped, the system will use the database deployment user by default, and no password is required to access the database.

    ```bash
    ./add_user.sh
    Please enter the username:
    Please enter the password:
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the following message will be displayed in the console:

    ```plain
    [ADD USER COMPLETED]: User creation completed.
    ```

### Deploy KWDB Using kwbase CLI

#### Prerequisites

- The target node meets all the requirements for hardware, operating system, software, and ports.
- The user performing the deployment is the `root` user or a regular user with `sudo` privileges.
- KWDB source code is compiled and installed according to [KWDB Compilation and Installation Instructions](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb/blob/master/README.en.md#compilation-and-installation).

#### Steps

1. Navigate to the directory where the `kwbase` script is located:

   ```bash
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb/install/bin
   ```

2. (Optional) For secure mode, create certificates and keys by following these steps:

   1. Create a directory to store the certificates and keys:

        ```bash
        mkdir -p <certs_dir>
        ```

   2. Generate certificates and keys:

        ```bash
        # Create database certificate authority and key
        ./kwbase cert create-ca --certs-dir=<certs_dir> --ca-key=<certs_dir>/ca.key && \

        # Create client certificate and key for database installation user (replace username with actual username)
        ./kwbase cert create-client <username> --certs-dir=<certs_dir> --ca-key=<certs_dir>/ca.key && \

        # Create node certificate and key
        ./kwbase cert create-node 127.0.0.1 localhost 0.0.0.0 --certs-dir=<certs_dir> --ca-key=<certs_dir>/ca.key
        ```

3. Start the database.

    - Insecure mode:

        ```bash
        ./kwbase start-single-node --insecure \
            --listen-addr=0.0.0.0:26257 \
            --http-addr=0.0.0.0:8080 \
            --store=/var/lib/kaiwudb
        ```

    - Secure mode:

        ```bash
        ./kwbase start-single-node \
            --certs-dir=<certs_dir> \
            --listen-addr=0.0.0.0:26257 \
            --http-addr=0.0.0.0:8080 \
            --store=/var/lib/kaiwudb
        ```

4. Check database status.

    - Insecure mode:

        ```bash
        ./kwbase node status --insecure --host=<address_of_any_alive_node>
        ```

    - Secure mode:

        ```bash
        ./kwbase node status --certs-dir=<certs_dir> --host=<address_of_any_alive_node>
        ```

5. (Optional) Create a database user and grant administrator privileges to the user. If this step is skipped, the system will use database deployment user by default, and no password is required to access the database.

    - Insecure mode (without password):

        ```bash
        ./kwbase sql --host=127.0.0.1:<local_port> --insecure \
        -e "create user <username>; \
            grant admin to <username> with admin option;"
        ```

    - Secure mode (with password):

        ```bash
        ./kwbase sql --certs-dir=<certs_dir> --host=127.0.0.1:<local_port> \
        -e "create user <username> with password \"<user_password>\"; \
            grant admin to <username> with admin option;"
        ```
