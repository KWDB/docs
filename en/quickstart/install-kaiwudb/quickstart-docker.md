## Preparation

### Hardware

The following specifications are required for KWDB deployment:

| Item  | Requirements  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU and Memory | - Minimum: 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM per node <br> - For high-volume data, complex workloads, high concurrency, or performance-critical applications, allocate additional resources accordingly |
| Disk       | - Recommended: SSD or NVMe devices<br>- Minimum performance: 500 IOPS and 30 MB/s throughput<br>- Storage: <1 GB for KWDB system, with additional space needed based on data volume<br>- Avoid shared storage (NFS, CIFS, CEPH)<br>- Avoid excessive device count and high write loads for deployment on HDDs, as concurrent writes can significantly degrade performance|

### Installation Packages and Docker Images

Use pre-compiled installation packages or compile from source code as needed.

#### Installation Package

Obtain the appropriate [installation package](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb/releases) for your system environment, copy the package to the target machine and then decompress it.

::: warning Note
Currently, the KWDB repository provides [installation packages](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb/releases/) for Ubuntu V22.04 ARM_64 and x86_64 architectures. For container installation packages of other versions, please contact [KWDB Technical Support](https://www.kaiwudb.com/support/).

:::

```shell
tar -zxvf <install_package_name>
```

The extracted `kwdb_install` directory contains the following files and folders:

| File/Folder          | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `add_user.sh`     | Script for creating KWDB users after installation and startup.           |
| `deploy.cfg`      | Configuration file for node IP addresses, ports, and other options. |
| `deploy.sh`       | Script for KWDB installation, uninstallation, start, status check, stop, start, and restart. |
| `packages`   | Stores image packages.                                    |
| `utils`      | Stores utility scripts.                                             |

#### Container Images

KWDB supports obtaining container images through the following methods:

- [Installation package](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb/releases): Download the installation package corresponding to your system environment, and after extraction, import the `KaiwuDB.tar` file from the `kwdb_install/packages` directory.

    ```bash
    docker load < KaiwuDB.tar
    Loaded image: "image-name"
    ```

- Docker command: Execute `docker pull kwdb/kwdb:<version>` to obtain the image.

## Deploy KWDB

### Deploy KWDB Using Scripts

When deploying KWDB using scripts, the system verifies configuration files, runtime environment, hardware setup, and software dependencies. The deployment will proceed with a warning if hardware requirements are not met, but will abort with error messages if required software dependencies are missing.

Deployment logs are saved in the `log` directory within `kwdb_install`. The system creates `/etc/kaiwudb/` and places the Docker Compose configuration file `docker-compose.yml` at `/etc/kaiwudb/script/`. For custom configurations of the startup flags and CPU resources, see [Cluster Configuration](../../deployment/cluster-config/cluster-config-docker.md).

#### Prerequisites

- The installation package is obtained.
- The target node meets all the requirements for hardware, operating system, software, and ports.
- The user performing the deployment is the `root` user or a regular user with `sudo` privileges:
  - `root` users or users with passwordless `sudo` configured will not be prompted for a password during script execution.
  - Users without passwordless `sudo` will be prompted to enter a password to escalate privileges.
- If the user is not a `root` user, add the user to the `docker` group by running `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`.  

#### Steps

1. Log in to the target node and edit the `deploy.cfg` file in the `kwdb_install` directory.

    ::: warning Note

    By default, the `deploy.cfg` configuration file includes cluster configuration parameters. Please remove or comment out the `[cluster]` section.

    :::

    Example:

    ```yaml
    [global]
    secure_mode=tls
    management_user=kaiwudb
    rest_port=8080
    kaiwudb_port=26257
    # brpc_port=27257
    data_root=/var/lib/kaiwudb
    cpu=1

    [local]
    node_addr=your-host-ip

    # [cluster]
    # node_addr=your-host-ip, your-host-ip
    # ssh_port=22
    # ssh_user=admin
    ```

    Parameters:

    | Configuration Level | Parameter | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | **global** | `secure_mode` | Defines the security mode. Options include:<br>- `insecure`: Enables insecure mode.<br>- `tls`: (Default) Enables secure mode. This generates TLS certificates for client and application connections, stored in `/etc/kaiwudb/certs`.|
    | | `management_user` | The user account for managing KWDB, set to `kaiwudb` by default. After installation, KWDB creates this user and a user group with the same name. |
    | | `rest_port` | Port for web services (default: `8080`). |
    | | `kaiwudb_port` | Port for client and application connections (default: `26257`). |
    | | `brpc_port` | The brpc communication port between KWDB time-series engines, used for inter-node communication. <br>This parameter can be omitted for single-node deployments; if specified, the system will automatically ignore it. |
    | | `data_root` | Data directory (default: `/var/lib/kaiwudb`). |
    | | `cpu` | (Optional) Specifies CPU usage for KWDB on the node. The default is unlimited. The value range is [0,1], with a precision of up to two decimal places. |
    | **local** | `node_addr` | The IP address for client and application connections. The default listening address is `0.0.0.0`, meaning the node will listen on `kaiwudb_port` across all IP addresses on the host. |

2. Grant execution permission to the `deploy.sh` script.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. Install KWDB in single-node mode.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh install --single
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the console will display the following message:

    ```shell
    INSTALL COMPLETED: KaiwuDB has been installed successfuly! ...
    ```

4. Reload the `systemd` daemon configuration.

    ```shell
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

5. Start KWDB.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh start
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the console will display the following message:

    ```shell
    START COMPLETED: KaiwuDB has started successfuly.
    ```

6. Check the system status.

    ```shell
    ./deploy.sh status
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    systemctl status kaiwudb
    ```

7. (Optional) Enable KWDB to start automatically after a system reboot.

    ```shell
    systemctl enable kaiwudb
    ```

8. (Optional) Run the `add_user.sh` script to create a database user. If skipped, the system will use database deployment user by default, and no password is required to access the database.

    ```bash
    ./add_user.sh
    Please enter the username:
    Please enter the password:
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the following message will be displayed in the console:

    ```shell
    [ADD USER COMPLETED]: User creation completed.
    ```

### Deploy KWDB using YAML Files

#### Prerequisites

- The Docker image is obtained.
- The target node meets all the requirements for hardware, operating system, software, and ports.
