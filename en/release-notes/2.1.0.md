# KWDB 2.1.0 Release Notes

KWDB is a distributed, multi-model database, designed for AIoT scenarios. It seamlessly integrates time-series and relational databases within the same instance, enabling efficient multi-model data processing. With high-performance time-series capabilities, it supports connections for tens of millions of devices, real-time insertion of millions of records within seconds, and query responses in just a few seconds for hundreds of millions of records. Built for stability, security, high availability, and easy maintenance, KWDB is ideal for industrial IoT, digital energy, connected vehicles, and smart industries, providing a unified platform for data storage, management, and analysis.

KWDB 2.1.0 retains the core features of previous versions while introducing enhancements in distributed architecture, DDL operations, data querying, storage, security, and database maintenance.

## New Features

### Distributed Architecture

- **Distributed Cluster**: Supports single-replica clusters

### DDL Operations

- **Online Tag Management**: Supports adding and deleting tags, as well as changing tag data types in real-time.
- **Default Values**: Allows adding, deleting, and modifying default values for the data fields of time-series tables.  
- **Materialized Views**: Supports creating, deleting, viewing, and renaming materialized views in relational databases.

### Data Querying

- **Difference Function**: Computes the difference between a columnâ€™s value and its previous non-NULL value in a time-series table.  
- **Automatic Data Sorting**: Supports automatic sorting of query results for single time-series table queries.
- **Cross-Model Query Optimization**: Improves performance for cross-model queries with configurable cluster parameters.
- **Row Count Control**: Allows setting query result row limits via cluster parameters.

### Data Storage

- **Data Compression and Reorganization**:
  - Supports real-time data compression.  
  - Evaluates data quality before compression to determine if reorganization is needed.  
  - Merges storage space based on actual write volume, reducing storage usage and improving query performance.

### Database Maintenance

- **GB18030 and GBK Encoding Support**: Supports GB18030, GBK, and other character encodings to ensure proper character handling across different connections.  
- **Import and Export Enhancements**:  
  - Allows filtering exported data using SQL query syntax.
  - Supports selecting character encodings, including GBK and GB18030.  
  - The relational engine supports column-specific imports, logs failed imports for error handling, and allows customization of delimiters, enclosures, escape characters, and null value representations. Users can also choose whether to include comments in import/export operations.
- **Session Timeout Configuration**: Supports session-level timeout settings, automatically disconnecting idle sessions after the configured duration.

## Important Changes

### Ecosystem Tools

- **DataX**: When writing data to KWDB using DataX, data can be split based on time intervals.  
- **KaiwuDB Developer Center** introduces the following new features and UI improvements:  
  - Time-series databases support partition interval settings.
  - Time-series tables support partition interval settings, data retention policies, and default field values.  
  - The relational engine now supports materialized view management.  
  - Import/export features now include a navigation bar and log viewing page.  

### Supported Languages and Database Connectors

- **New Framework Protocols**: Supports ThinkPHP, R2DBC, hsweb, and ADO.NET.  
- **RESTful API Enhancements**: Now supports database-level and session-level time zone configurations.  
- **Expanded Language Support**: Added configuration examples for C++, C#, Python, PHP, Java, Go, Node.js, R, and Rust.
