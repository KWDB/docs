# PostgreSQL Error Codes

KWDB uses several PostgreSQL error codes (PGcodes), along with some KWDB-specific error codes that are compatible with PGcode.

This section provides a list of PGcodes used in KWDB, along with recommended actions.

::: warning Note

Some PGcodes may correspond to multiple messages. While these messages may vary slightly, the underlying cause of the error remains consistent. The table below includes only the messages associated with the original PGcode error and does not cover KWDBâ€™s custom messages. Use the error code to identify the cause and take the appropriate action.
