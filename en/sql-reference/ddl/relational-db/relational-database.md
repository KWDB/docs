# Relational Databases

## CREATE DATABASE

The `CREATE DATABASE` statement creates a new relational database.

### Privileges

The user must be a member of the `admin` role. By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.

### Syntax

![](../../../../static//sql-reference/Bcilb9o3lo05ZzxPWancZzZFnxe.png)

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IF NOT EXISTS` | Optional. <br>- When the `IF NOT EXISTS` keyword is used, the system creates a new database only if a database of the same name does not already exist. Otherwise, the system fails to create a new database without returning an error. <br>- When the `IF NOT EXISTS` keyword is not used, the system creates a new database only if a database of the same name does not already exist. Otherwise, the system fails to create a new database and returns an error.|
| `db_name` | The name of the database to create, which must be unique and follow these [Identifier Rules](../../sql-identifiers.md). |
| `WITH` | Optional. Whether or not using the keyword does not affect the creation of the database. |
| `ENCODING` | Optional. Specify the encoding method. Currently, KWDB only supports UTF-8 and its alias (UTF8 and UNICODE). Values should be enclosed in single quotes (`' '`) and are case-insensitive, such as `CREATE DATABASE bank ENCODING = 'UTF-8'`. |

### Examples

- Create a database.

    This example creates a database named `db1`.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db1;
    CREATE DATABASE
    ```

- Create a database using the `IF NOT EXISITS` keyword.

    This example creates a database named `db1`, which has already exists. The system fails to create the database without returning an error.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db1;
    CREATE DATABASE
    ```

## SHOW DATABASES

The `SHOW DATABASES` statement lists all databases in the KWDB cluster, including relational databases and time-series databases.

### Privileges

N/A

### Syntax

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `WITH COMMENT` | Optional. Show a database's comments. By default, the database's comment is set to `NULL`. |

### Examples

:::warning Note
The `engine_type` for time-series databases and relational databases is `TIME SERIES` and `RELATIONAL` respectively.
:::

- Show all created databases.

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

    If you succeed, you should see an output similar to the following:

    ```sql
      database_name | engine_type
    ----------------+--------------
      db1           | RELATIONAL
      db2           | RELATIONAL
      defaultdb     | RELATIONAL
      postgres      | RELATIONAL
      system        | RELATIONAL
      iot           | TIME SERIES 
    (6 rows)
    ```

- Show all created databases' comments.

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES WITH COMMENT;
    ```

    If you succeed, you should see an output similar to the following:

    ```sql
      database_name | engine_type | comment
    ----------------+-------------+----------
      db1           | RELATIONAL  | NULL
      db2           | RELATIONAL  | NULL
      defaultdb     | RELATIONAL  | NULL
      postgres      | RELATIONAL  | NULL
      system        | RELATIONAL  | NULL
      iot           | TIME SERIES | NULL
    (6 rows)
    ```

## SHOW CREATE DATABASE

The `SHOW CREATE DATABASE` statement shows the `CREATE DATABASE` statement for an existing database. Currently, the relational database only supports viewing the name of the database.

### Privileges

N/A

### Syntax

![](../../../../static/sql-reference/showcreatedb.png)

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `database_name` | The name of the database to view. |

### Examples

This example shows the statement that is used to create the `reldb1` database.

```sql
-- 1. Create a database named reldb1.

CREATE DATABASE reldb1 WITH ENCODING = 'UTF8';

--2. Show the created reldb1 database.

SHOW CREATE DATABASE reldb1;
  database_name |    create_statement
----------------+-------------------------
  reldb1        | CREATE DATABASE reldb1
(1 row)
```

## ALTER DATABASE

The `ALTER DATABASE` statement applies a name or zone configurations to a database.

::: warning Note
KWDB does not support changing the name of a database which has dependent views.
:::

### Privileges

- Change the name of the database
  The user must be the Admin user or a member of the `admin` role. By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.
- Change the zone configurations of the system database
  The user must be the Admin user or a member of the `admin` role.
- Modify zones for other databases
  The user must have been granted `CREATE` or `ZONECONFIG` privileges on the specified database(s).

### Syntax

![](../../../../static/sql-reference/alter-db-rdb.png)

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `database_name` | The name of the database to change. If the target database is the current database, set the `sql_safe_updates` parameter to `true`. Otherwise, the database cannot be renamed. |
| `new_name` | The new name of the database, which must be unique and follow these [Identifier Rules](../../sql-identifiers.md).|
| `variable` | The name of the variable to change. The relational database supports updating the following variables: <br>- `range_min_bytes`: the minimum size in bytes for a range of data in the zone. When a range is less than this size, KWDB will merge it with the adjacent range. By default, it is set to `256 MiB`. The value should be greater then `1 MiB` (1048576 bytes) and smaller than the maximum size of the range. <br>- `range_max_bytes`: the maximum size in bytes for a range of data in the zone. When a range reaches this size, KWDB will split it into two ranges. By default, it is set to `512 MiB`. The value should not be smaller than `5 MiB` (5242880 bytes). <br>- `gc.ttlseconds`: the number of seconds that data will be retained before garbage collection (unit: second). By default, it is set to `90000` (25 hours). It is recommended to set a value that is greater than or equal to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to avoid affecting long-time data queries. A smaller value can save disk space while a greater value will increase the interval allowed for `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries. In addition, it is not recommended to set a so great value because all versions of each row are stored in a single, unsplit zone. This can help prevent the updates exceeding 64 MiB, which may cause a memory lack or other issues. <br>- `num_replicas`: the number of replicas in the zone. By default, it is set to `3`. By default, for the `system` database and the `meta`, `liveness`, and `system` ranges, it is set to `5`. **Note**: The number of the replicas cannot be decreased when unavailable nodes are in the KWDB cluster. <br>- `constraints`: an array of required (+) and/or prohibited (-) constraints influencing the location of replicas. <br> - `lease_preferences`: an ordered list of required and/or prohibited (-) constraints influencing the location of leaseholders. Whether each constraint is required or prohibited is expressed with a leading + or -, respectively. Note that lease preference constraints do not have to be shared with the `constraints` field. For example, it's valid for your configuration to define a `lease_preferences` field that does not reference any values from the `constraints` field.  It is also valid to define a `lease_preferences` field with no `constraints` field at all. If the first preference cannot be satisfied, KWDB will attempt to satisfy the second preference, and so on. If none of the preferences can be met, the lease will be placed using the default lease placement algorithm, which is to base lease placement decisions on how many leases each node already has, trying to make all the nodes have around the same amount. Each value in the list can include multiple constraints. For example, the list `[[+zone=us-east-1b, +ssd], [+zone=us-east-1a], [+zone=us-east-1c, +ssd]]` means preferring nodes with an SSD in `us-east-1b`, then any nodes in `us-east-1a`, then nodes in `us-east-1c` with an SSD. <br > Default: no lease location preferences are applied if this field is not specified. |
| `value` | The value of the variable to change. |
|`COPY FROM PARENT`| Use the settings of the parent zone. |
|`DISCARD` | Remove the zone settings and use the default values. |

### Examples

- Change the name of a database.

    This example renames the `rdb` database to `relationaldb`.

    ```sql
    -- 1. Show all databases.
    
    SHOW DATABASES;
    database_name|engine_type
    -------------+-----------
    defaultdb    |RELATIONAL
    postgres     |RELATIONAL
    rdb          |RELATIONAL
    system       |RELATIONAL
    tsdb         |TIME SERIES
    (5 rows)
    
    -- 2. Rename the rdb database to relationaldb.
    
    ALTER DATABASE rdb RENAME TO relationaldb;
    ALTER DATABASE
    
    -- 3. Show all databases.
    
    SHOW DATABASES;
    database_name|engine_type
    -------------+-----------
    defaultdb    |RELATIONAL
    postgres     |RELATIONAL
    relationaldb |RELATIONAL
    system       |RELATIONAL
    tsdb         |TIME SERIES
    (5 rows)
    ```

- Change the zone configurations of a database.
  
    This example sets the number of the replicas of the `db3` database to `5` and the time to retain data before garbage collection to `100000` seconds.
  
  ```sql
  -- 1. Change the zone configurations of the tsdb database.

  ALTER DATABASE db3 CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 5, gc.ttlseconds = 100000;
  CONFIGURE ZONE 1

  -- 2. Check whether the configurations are applied successfully. 

  SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR DATABASE db3;
        target  |               raw_config_sql
  -------------------+------------------------------------------
    DATABASE db3 | ALTER DATABASE db3 CONFIGURE ZONE USING
                |     range_min_bytes = 134217728,
                |     range_max_bytes = 536870912,
                |     gc.ttlseconds = 100000,
                |     num_replicas = 5,
                |     constraints = '[]',
                |     lease_preferences = '[]'
  (1 row)
  ```
  
## DROP DATABASE

The `DROP DATABASE` statement removes a database and all its objects from a KWDB cluster. To remove the current database, use the `USE <database_name>` statement to set another database as the current database. After deletion, all privileges on the database and its tables are also removed.

### Privileges

The user must have the `DROP` privilege on the specified database and tables in the database.

### Syntax

![](../../../../static/sql-reference/QQb2bK7kgo7ieYxhlMNcgQsondf.png)

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IF EXISTS` | Optional. <br>- When the `IF EXISTS` keyword is used, the system removes the database only if the database has already existed. Otherwise, the system fails to remove the database without returning an error. <br>- When the `IF EXISTS` keyword is not used, the system removes the database only if the database has already existed. Otherwise, the system fails to remove the database and returns an error. |
| `database_name` | The name of the database to remove. |
| `CASCADE` | Optional. Remove tables and views in the database as well as all objects (such as constraints and views) that depend on those tables. The `CASCADE` keyword does not list objects it removes, so it should be used cautiously.|
| `RESTRICT` | Optional. Do not remove the database if it contains any tables or views.|

### Examples

- Remove a database and its dependent objects using the `CASCADE` keyword.

    ```sql
    -- 1. Show tables in the relationaldb database.

    SHOW TABLES FROM relationaldb;
    table_name|table_type
    ----------+----------
    ints      |BASE TABLE
    (1 row)

    -- 2. Remove the relationaldb database and its dependent objects.

    DROP DATABASE relationaldb CASCADE;
    DROP DATABASE

    -- 3. Show tables in the relationaldb database.

    SHOW TABLES FROM relationaldb;
    ERROR: target database or schema does not exist
    ```

- Remove a database and its dependent objects using the `RESTRICT` keyword.

    ```sql
    -- 1. Show tables in the db1 database.
    
    SHOW TABLES FROM db1;
    table_name|table_type
    ----------+----------
    int       |BASE TABLE
    ints      |BASE TABLE
    (2 rows)
    
    -- 2. Remove the db1 database.
    
    DROP DATABASE db1 RESTRICT;
    ERROR:  database "db1" is not empty and RESTRICT was specified
    ```
